# Further thoughts
What else do you want to say about the feature that might not have its place in any above categories? (Maybe soft requirements)

# Miscellaneous
Anything that you would want to say but does not help describe the techical requirements for the feature (like your state of mind while writing the Feature Description, what you ate for dinner, how long you've been awake, when your last shower was, your thoughts about the color of that mole you're wondering about for several months now but neve went to check out...)
