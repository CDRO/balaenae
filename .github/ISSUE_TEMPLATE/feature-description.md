# Goal
Describe the feature in general in a way that a developers quickly understands what is expected to be done. This description does not server for assessment of doability but for a rough overview on what is to be done.
Ideally this description can be used 1:1 in the documentation to describe the new feature, so that the developer simply can create the technical part of the documentation.

# How to achieve
Ideally this part is written by the developer, once the ticket is assigned. This will help discussing an implementation idea with a pair in order to assess the doability of the proposed solution. It also serves as a documentation point further down the road, so taking time to do it properly will save time later on.
## What technology do you want to use
## How will you go about achieving your goal
## What architectural considerations have to be taken (if applicable)
## Impact on extendability (if applicable)
## Impact on maintainability (if applicable)

# Testing

# Further thoughts
What else do you want to say about the feature that might not have its place in any above categories? (Maybe soft requirements)
This should be written by the creator of the Feature Description as well as the developer, when something comes up that might need further investigating, although in most cases, a new Issue should probably be opened instead.

# Miscellaneous
Anything that you would want to say but does not help describe the techical requirements for the feature (like your state of mind while writing the Feature Description, what you ate for dinner, how long you've been awake, when your last shower was, your thoughts about the color of that mole you're wondering about for several months now but neve went to check out...)
